# Project Intro
By researching who are supporting the BLM, where they are located, and how they expressed themselves, we plan to visualize the movement, sourcing from the US Crisis Monitor which has been updating data regarding extended coverage back to the week of George Floyd’s killing in May. In addition, we would also utilize collected data from Twitter hashtags via web scraping (using a NLP model from MIT Media Lab). We also intend to explore the social, political and economical influences instigated by the protest, including widely supported public announcement and opinions as well as their outcomes. An additional theme of visualization we are interested in exploring is the relationship between the ACAB (all police are bad) Movement and their associated development with changes in frequency of the cities’ crime rate. We will take consideration of the fact that these numbers would be amplified during the co-occurring pandemic. Through this visualization, we hope to bring forward the insight of modern US culture regarding political justice and ethical baselines, especially in such difficult times.
